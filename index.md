### Introduction
Websites have evolved from simple pages with a little CSS to far more complicated and powerful applications in recent years.

Programmers use different patterns and software architectures to make the code less difficult, making these applications easier to develop.

`Model-View-Controller Architecture (MVC)` is a design pattern for web applications that consists of three interconnected parts(Model View and the Controller). It is the most popular software architecture by far. In this tutorial, we will look at how the MVC work. 

MVC frameworks are an essential component of modern web application development. If you happen to walk into any developers room, don't be amused with the mention of Yii2,Laravel,Django,Ruby any any other framework.

### What is a Framework?
`Framework` is a skeleton solution(it gives the outline) in which specific element must be plugged in order to establish an actual solution. They are made up of a set of related classes that can be specialized to impleament an application.

### Software Architecture Defination
Architecture is a systematic way in which software is described. It also refers to its relationship with other software, and how they interact with each other.
